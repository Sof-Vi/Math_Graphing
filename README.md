# **Math_Graphing**

## Purpose
This project explores **multivariable graphing** as a foundation for future **curve fitting** graphing. The goal is to visualize how variables interact in 2D spaces gradually building towards modeling data with functions.
## Current state of the project
- Creating **scatter plots** for randomly generated data points (January 21, 2026.)

## Future plans for the project 
- Creating **scatter plots** for a dataset 
- Creating approximate functions to explain a set otherwise ( **curve fitting** ).

## Requirements 
- python ver 3.10.16
- Libraries: (numpy, matplotlib)
