# **Math_Graphing**

## Purpose
This project explores **multivariable graphing** as a foundation for future **curve fitting** graphing. The goal is to visualize how variables interact in 2D spaces gradually building towards modeling data with functions.

## Current state of the project
- Creating **scatter plots** for randomly generated data points (January 21, 2026.)
- Creating **scatter plots** for a dataset in the python user face (January 22, 2026.)
- Tested **scatter plots for randomly generated data points, and dataset plots**, as well as fixed some issues. (February 8, 2026.)
  
## Future plans for the project  
- Creating approximate functions to explain a set otherwise ( **curve fitting** ).
- Creating a way to **read data from an excel document**.
- Creating a way to take **data from an excel document and graphing it on command**.
  
## Requirements 
- python ver 3.10.16
- Libraries: (numpy, matplotlib)
